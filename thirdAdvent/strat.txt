Objective: find common char in a line split by half, return its custom priority
Procedure:
-read whole file, split by \n
-make a function that returns char priority based on ASCII
    -if ASCII > 90 = lower, else = upper
    -return calculated priority (char ASCII - 96 || 38)
-iterate through all lines, split them by half = localVar1,localVar2
-send localVars to findMatch function
-make findMatch function, should receive 2 params, iterates through them with nested for
    -if localVar1[i] === localVar2[j], return charPriority(localVar1[i])
