Objective: look for a pair that is contained within another
Procedure:
-store endpoints{
    lines = input from file
    newLines = lines' escape characters replaced by commas
    TODO separate and store pairs by commas
    TODO treat each member of the pair as an individual
}
-compare endpoints a,b/c,d
-if a<c&&b>d -> means pair c,d is completely engulfed within pair a,b
