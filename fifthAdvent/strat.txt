Objective: rearrange arrays and read last index of each one
Procedure:
- make an array with each column (9 array seems excessive, maybe nested arrays?)
    -fill subarrays with for loop with nested switch
    -start reading from eighth line, on its index, upwards (let i = 0; i <=7; i--) (start reading at [1] and iterate +4)
    -whitespace handling
- make function that reads movements
    -map array splitting by " "
    -splice to remove "move", "from" and "to"
- make a function that pops and pushes values
